# ☕ Brewing Insights: Forecasting Coffee Production Trends Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Problem Statement
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, with fluctuating production patterns influenced by demand, climate, and regional factors. Accurately predicting coffee production is vital for stakeholders to plan supply chain logistics, meet global demand, and stabilize market prices. This project aims to predict future coffee production using linear regression models based on historical consumption and production data.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model using Linear Regression and its regularized variants (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) to accurately predict coffee production and provide insights that can assist producers, distributors, and decision-makers in the coffee industry.

## 🎯 Key Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and correlations.
- Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model for predicting coffee production.
- Compare model performance using Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.
- Assess the impact of different features on production outcomes.
- Visualize actual vs. predicted results for better interpretation.

## 🔍 Key Aspects Covered
- Data preprocessing and handling missing/null values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with trend visualization.
- Feature selection and transformation.
- Model training and testing using multiple regression techniques.
- Model evaluation using R² Score, RMSE, and MAE.
- Visual comparison of predictions vs. actual production values.

## 💼 Business Impact
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Enables suppliers and producers to make data-driven decisions based on forecasted production levels.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Helps optimize procurement, warehousing, and distribution based on expected demand.
- **Market Stability:** Reduces risks of overproduction or underproduction, potentially stabilizing prices.
- **Strategic Planning:** Provides a foundation for long-term planning in coffee farming and export management.

## ✅ Conclusion
- The Linear Regression and its regularized models achieved strong performance (R² > 0.90), demonstrating the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns in the data.
- Regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso proved effective in maintaining performance while reducing the risk of overfitting.
- The project reveals that historical consumption trends are a reliable predictor of future coffee production.
- Future enhancements can include integrating weather data, region-wise economic factors, or using time-series methods for even more precise forecasting.
